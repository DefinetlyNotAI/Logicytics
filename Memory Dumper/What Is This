DumpIt.exe is a 3rd party software tool..

I included it here as I was too lazy to develop a memory dumper.

I am not held liable for this exe file, I have tested it, and it does its job, proceed with caution!

After running it in admin mode, it will ask you to input "y", after input it will automatically BSOD the computer!
And then create a RAW Dump File, from there you can forensic into it,
the main program also includes what Sensitive processes are running that may give private data,

As withe everything, this is for educational purposes only!
