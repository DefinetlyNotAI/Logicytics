# Welcome to the Logicytics - PACKAGES Directory

This directory houses special scripts that don't directly interact with Logicytics.
These scripts are designed to be used outside Logicytics and are meant for use with other dev tools. 

The scripts located here are designed to be used by Developers and are meant for external use.
They are designed to interact with Logicytics from an outside perspective like generating `msi` installers
and are not designed to be run independently or run by the main scripts. 

## What can be found in this directory?

This directory contains special scripts that interact with Logicytics in a directory of their own mission.
So a directory named `INSTALLER` contains everything needed for the `msi` installer.

## Why should I use this directory?

This directory is designed to house special scripts that interact outside Logicytics.
If you are looking to develop tools for Logicytics without adding core functionality,
this is the directory you should be looking in.
