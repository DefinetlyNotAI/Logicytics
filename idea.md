Create a roadmap first

---

Here are some ideas for a future roadmap for the Logicytics project:

1. **Enhanced Data Collection:**
   - Expand the types of data collected to include more system logs and application-specific logs.
   - Implement real-time data collection and monitoring capabilities.

2. **Improved Analysis Tools:**
   - Develop more sophisticated data analysis tools to help users make sense of the collected data.
   - Integrate machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and potential security threats automatically.

3. **User Interface Enhancements:**
   - Create a web-based dashboard for visualizing and interacting with the collected data.
   - Implement customizable reports and alerts that users can configure based on specific criteria.

4. **Integration with Other Tools:**
   - Enable integration with popular SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems.
   - Provide APIs for other tools to interact with Logicytics data.

5. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Optimize data collection processes to reduce the impact on system performance.
   - Implement data compression techniques to minimize storage requirements.

6. **Documentation and Community Engagement:**
   - Enhance documentation to provide detailed guides on using and extending Logicytics.
   - Create a community forum or discussion platform for users to share tips, ask questions, and suggest features.

These ideas can help guide the development of Logicytics and ensure it continues to provide valuable functionality for its users.

Based on the recent releases, here are some additional ideas for the Logicytics roadmap:

1. **Advanced Security Measures:**
   - Implement proactive security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities before they become issues.
   - Integrate with third-party security services to provide comprehensive security assessments.

2. **User Experience Improvements:**
   - Develop a user-friendly GUI for less technical users to interact with the tool.
   - Add customizable dashboards to monitor key metrics and system statuses in real-time.

3. **Automation and Scripting:**
   - Introduce automation scripts for common tasks and allow users to create custom scripts.
   - Provide an API for integrating with other automation tools and workflows.

4. **Enhanced Reporting:**
   - Generate detailed reports with insights and recommendations based on collected data.
   - Allow users to schedule regular reports and send them via email or other communication channels.

5. **Cloud Integration:**
   - Enable cloud storage options for collected data, making it accessible from anywhere.
   - Integrate with cloud-based SIEM solutions for extended analytics.

Based on the gathered information, here are some recommendations to add extra tools and improve the contribution process for the `DefinetlyNotAI/Logicytics` repository:

### Additional Tools
1. **Network Traffic Analyzer**:
   - Add a tool to capture and analyze network traffic, which can help in forensic investigations.
   - Example: A Python script using libraries like `scapy` or `pyshark`.

2. **Memory Dump Analyzer**:
   - Integrate a tool to capture and analyze memory dumps, useful for in-depth forensic analysis.
   - Example: A tool using `volatility` framework to extract useful information from memory dumps.

3. **Event Log Parser**:
   - Implement a parser for Windows Event Logs to extract and analyze security-related events.
   - Example: A Python script using `pywin32` to read and parse event logs.

1. **Enhance Documentation**:
   - Use tools like `Sphinx` to generate documentation from docstrings and maintain it in a readable format.
