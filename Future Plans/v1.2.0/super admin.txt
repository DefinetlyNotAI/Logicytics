2. *Open Command Prompt as Administrator*: To use PsExec, you need to open a Command Prompt window with administrator privileges. You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu, right-clicking on "Command Prompt", and selecting "Run as administrator".

3. *Navigate to PsExec Directory*: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you downloaded PsExec. For example, if you downloaded it to C:\Tools, you would use the command cd C:\Tools.

4. *Run the Python Script with TrustedInstaller*: Use the following command to run your Python script with TrustedInstaller privileges:

cmd
psexec -i -s cmd /c "python path\to\your\script.py"
