# Python Script Explanation

This Python script is designed to gather and display various system information, including details about running processes, Windows version, network information, computer model, and hardware specifications such as CPU, GPU, RAM, and SSD. It uses a combination of Python's built-in modules and external commands to collect this information. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

## Import Required Modules

```python
import getpass
import socket
import subprocess
import re
import uuid
import psutil
import wmi
```

The script imports necessary modules for user and system information retrieval, network operations, subprocess management, regular expressions, unique identifier generation, process monitoring, and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

## Define Functions

### `filter_processes()`

This function filters and prints the names and PIDs of running processes that match predefined criteria (system, network, web browser, email client, office, and antivirus/security processes).

### `extract_version_number(output)`

This function extracts version numbers from a given output string using a regular expression pattern that matches sequences of digits separated by dots, ensuring there are at least two dots.

### `get_windows_version_info()`

This function executes a Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) command to get the Windows version and type, then uses `extract_version_number` to extract the version number and a regular expression to extract the type (Home or Enterprise).

### `get_network_info()`

This function retrieves the hostname, IPv4 address, IPv6 addresses, and MAC address of the computer. It uses the `socket` module for hostname and IP address retrieval and a workaround with `uuid` to generate a MAC address-like identifier.

### `get_computer_model()`

This function uses the `wmi` module to query the computer model from the `Win32_ComputerSystem` WMI class.

### `execute_command(command)`

This function executes a given command using `subprocess.Popen` and returns the standard output and standard error as text.

## Execution

The script executes a series of functions to gather and display system information, including:

- Filtering and printing running processes that match certain criteria.
- Displaying the computer model.
- Executing and displaying information about the CPU, GPU, RAM, and SSD.
- Displaying the Windows version number and type.
- Displaying network information, including IPv4, IPv6, and a MAC address-like identifier.

This script is useful for quickly gathering detailed system information, which can be helpful for system administrators, IT professionals, or users looking to understand their system's specifications and configuration.
