# Batch Script for Running the Tree Command and Saving Output

This batch script is designed to execute the `tree` command on a Windows system, capturing the output and saving it to a file named after the current user. It leverages PowerShell to run the `tree` command and redirect its output to a file. Below is a detailed explanation of its components and functionalities.

## Script Start

```batch
@echo off
setlocal
```
- `@echo off` disables the display of commands in the command prompt window.
- `setlocal` starts localization of environment changes in a batch file, limiting the scope of variables to the batch file.

## Getting the Current User's Name

```batch
for /f "tokens=*"
```
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate over the output of the command enclosed in parentheses. The `"tokens=*"` option tells the loop to treat the entire line as a single token, assigning it to the variable `%%i`.
- `do set userName=%%i` assigns the value of `%%i` to the variable `userName`.

## Defining the Output File Name

```batch
set outputFile=%userName%_tree.txt
```
- Constructs the output file name by appending `_tree.txt` to the current user's name, stored in the `userName` variable.

## Executing the Tree Command and Redirecting Output

```batch
powershell.exe -Command "& {tree C:\ | Out-File -FilePath %outputFile%}"
```
- Executes PowerShell with the `-Command` parameter, running the command inside the curly braces `{}`.
- The `tree C:\` command generates a tree-like listing of the C:\ drive.
- `Out-File -FilePath %outputFile%` redirects the output of the `tree` command to a file whose path is defined by `%outputFile%`.

## Echoing Completion Message

```batch
echo INFO: Completed tree command Execution and saved to %outputFile%.
```
- Displays a message indicating that the `tree` command has been executed and its output has been saved to the specified file.

## Conclusion

This batch script is a simple yet effective tool for generating a directory tree of the C:\ drive and saving it to a file named after the current user. It demonstrates the use of batch scripting for executing PowerShell commands and handling file operations, making it a valuable utility for system administrators and users alike.
