# Python Script Explanation

This Python script is designed to copy specific folders from a user's profile to a designated destination within the script's directory, providing an estimate of the folder sizes and displaying a progress bar during the copy process. Here's a breakdown of the script:

## Import Required Modules

```python
import os
import shutil
from tqdm import tqdm
```

The script imports the `os` and `shutil` modules for file and directory operations, and `tqdm` for displaying a progress bar.

## Define Functions

### `estimate_folder_size(folder_path)`

```python
def estimate_folder_size(folder_path):
    """Estimate the size of a folder."""
    total_size = 0
    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(str(folder_path)):
        for f in filenames:
            fp = os.path.join(str(dirpath), f)
            total_size += os.path.getsize(fp)
    return total_size
```

This function walks through the specified folder and its subdirectories, summing up the sizes of all files to estimate the total size of the folder.

### `copy_folders(source_paths, destination_path)`

```python
def copy_folders(source_paths, destination_path):
    """Copy folders to a specified destination with a progress bar."""
    for source_path in tqdm(source_paths, desc="Copying folders"):
        shutil.copytree(str(source_path), os.path.join(str(destination_path), os.path.basename(str(source_path))))
```

This function iterates over each source path, copying it to the destination path. It uses `tqdm` to display a progress bar for each folder being copied.

## `main()`

```python
def main():
    # Get the current user's username
    username = os.getlogin()

    # Define the source folders using the current user's username
    source_folders = [
        f"C:/Users/{username}/Music",
        f"C:/Users/{username}/Pictures",
        f"C:/Users/{username}/Videos"
    ]

    # Get the script's directory
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
    # Define the destination folder as a DATA folder within the script's directory
    destination_folder = os.path.join(script_dir, "DATA")

    # Create the DATA folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(destination_folder):
        os.makedirs(destination_folder)

    # Estimate the sizes of the source folders
    estimated_sizes = {}
    for folder in source_folders:
        if os.path.exists(folder):
            estimated_sizes[folder] = estimate_folder_size(folder)
        else:
            print(f"ERROR: Folder not found: {folder}")

    # Proceed with copying the folders without user confirmation
    copy_folders(source_folders, destination_folder)
    print("INFO: Folders copied successfully.")
```

The `main` function performs the following actions:

1. Retrieve the current user's username.
2. Define the source folders to be copied, using the current user's username.
3. Determines the script's directory and defines the destination folder as a "DATA" folder within the script's directory.
4. Create the destination folder if it doesn't exist.
5. Estimates the sizes of the source folders and stores them in a dictionary.
6. Copies the source folders to the destination folder, displaying a progress bar for each folder.
7. Print a success message upon completion.

This script is useful for backing up or archiving user data from specific folders, providing both functionality and feedback to the user.
