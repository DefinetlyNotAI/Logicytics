# PowerShell Script Explanation

This PowerShell script is designed to find and delete directories named "DATA" within the current working directory. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the script:

## Get the Current Working Directory

```powershell
$currentWorkingDir = Get-Location
```

This line retrieves the path of the current working directory using the `Get-Location` cmdlet and stores it in the variable `$currentWorkingDir`.

## Define the Directory Name to Look For

```powershell
$directoryName = "DATA"
```

Here, the script defines the name of the directory it aims to find and delete, which is "DATA".

## Get All Directories in the Current Working Directory

```powershell
$directories = Get-ChildItem -Directory
```

Using the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet with the `-Directory` parameter, the script retrieves all directories within the current working directory and stores them in the `$directories` variable.

## Loop Through Each Directory

```powershell
foreach ($dir in $directories) {
   ...
}
```

The script enters a loop where it processes each directory stored in the `$directories` variable.

### Check if the Directory Name Matches the Target

```powershell
if ($dir.Name -eq $directoryName) {
   ...
}
```

Inside the loop, the script checks if the name of the current directory (`$dir.Name`) exactly matches the target directory name defined earlier ("DATA").

### Attempt to Delete the Directory

```powershell
try {
    Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $dir.FullName
    Write-Host "'$($dir.FullName)' has been deleted."
} catch {
    Write-Host "Failed to delete '$($dir.FullName)': $_"
}
```

If the directory name matches, the script attempts to delete the directory using the `Remove-Item` cmdlet with the `-Recurse` and `-Force` parameters. This ensures that the directory and all its contents are forcefully removed. Upon successful deletion, it prints a confirmation message. In case of failure, it catches the error and prints a failure message along with the error details.

## Final Message

```powershell
Write-Host "Script completed. All 'DATA' directories found have been deleted."
```

After processing all directories, the script concludes by printing a final message indicating that the operation has completed and all matching directories have been successfully deleted.

This script is a straightforward example of how to automate the process of deleting specific directories based on their names, which can be particularly useful in scenarios such as cleaning up temporary data or removing old backups.
