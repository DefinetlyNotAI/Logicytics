# Python Script for Searching Stored Passwords

This Python script is designed to search for stored passwords across various locations on a Windows system, including the filesystem, desktop, registry, Google Chrome, and Opera browsers. It uses a combination of standard library modules such as `os`, `sqlite3`, `winreg`, and third-party modules like `shutil` and `colorlog` for file manipulation and logging. Below is a detailed explanation of its components and functionalities.

## Imports

```python
import os
import sqlite3
import winreg
import shutil
import colorlog
```

- **os**: Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
- **sqlite3**: Enables connecting to SQLite databases and executing SQL queries.
- **winreg**: Offers access to the Windows Registry.
- **shutil**: Provides high-level file operations.
- **colorlog**: Enhances the logging module with colored output.

## Logging Configuration

```python
logger = colorlog.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(colorlog.INFO)
handler = colorlog.StreamHandler()
formatter = colorlog.ColoredFormatter(...)
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

- Configure a logger with color-coded output for different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).

## Functions

### `copy_file(src_path, dest_dir)`
Copies a file from a source path to a destination directory, creating the directory if it doesn't exist.

### `search_filesystem()`
Search the filesystem for files containing the word "password" in their content, specifically looking at XML, INI, and TXT files. Copies any found files to a designated folder.

### `search_desktop()`
Scans the user's Desktop for files containing "password" in their name and copies them to a specified directory.

### `search_registry()`
Queries the Windows Registry for keys related to passwords, logging any found entries.

### `search_google()`
Attempts to read the Chrome browser's login data SQLite database for stored passwords, logging any found credentials.

### `search_opera()`
Similar to `search_google()`, but reads the Opera browser's login data SQLite database for stored passwords.

## Main Functionality

```python
def main():
    search_registry()
    search_filesystem()
    search_desktop()
    search_google()
    search_opera()
```

- Orchestrates the execution of all search functions, systematically checking the registry, filesystem, desktop, and both Google Chrome and Opera browsers for stored passwords.

## Execution

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- Ensures the `main()` function is called when the script is executed directly.

## Conclusion

This script is a comprehensive tool for locating and logging stored passwords across various sources on a Windows system. It demonstrates effective use of Python's standard library for interacting with the filesystem, registry, and external applications like web browsers. The use of `colorlog` enhances the script's usability by providing clear, color-coded feedback on its operation.
