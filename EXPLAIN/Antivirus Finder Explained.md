# PowerShell Script Explanation

This PowerShell script is designed to search through the output of the `tree` command for specific antivirus software names. It then reports back on what it found. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the script does:

## Define the List of Antivirus Names

```powershell
$antivirusNames = @("Norton", "McAfee", "Avast", "AVG", "Bitdefender", "Kaspersky", "ESET", "Sophos", "TrendMicro", "Comodo", "Panda", "Avira", "F-Secure", "GData", "Malwarebytes", "Spybot", "ZoneAlarm", "Webroot")
```

This line initializes an array with the names of various antivirus software. The script will search for these names in the output of the `tree` command.

## Check for the 'tree' Command

```powershell
if (-not (Get-Command tree -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    Write-Host "tree command not found. Please install or use an alternative method."
    exit
}
```

This block checks if the `tree` command is available on the system. If it's not found, the script informs the user and exits.

## Run the 'tree' Command and Process Its Output

```powershell
$treeOutput = tree /f
$lines = $treeOutput -split "`n"
```

The script runs the `tree` command with the `/f` flag to display the directory structure in a tree-like format. It then splits the output into lines for processing.

## Remove Duplicates from the Antivirus Names List

```powershell
$antivirusNames = $antivirusNames | Sort-Object | Get-Unique
```

This line sorts the antivirus names and removes any duplicates, ensuring that each name is unique in the list.

## Initialize Variables for Progress Tracking

```powershell
$completedLines = 0
$foundAntivirus = @()
```

These lines initialize variables to keep track of how many lines have been processed and to store any antivirus names found.

## Process Each Line

```powershell
foreach ($line in $lines) {
    $completedLines++
    foreach ($name in $antivirusNames) {
        if ($line -match "\b$name\b") {
            $foundAntivirus += $name
        }
    }
}
```

The script iterates over each line of the `tree` command's output. For each line, it checks if any of the antivirus names are present as complete words. If a match is found, the name is added to the `$foundAntivirus` array.

## Report Findings

```powershell
Write-Host "Processed $completedLines lines."
if ($foundAntivirus.Count -gt 0) {
    Write-Host "Found Antivirus:"
    $foundAntivirus | Sort-Object -Unique | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_ }
} else {
    Write-Host "No antivirus found."
}
```

Finally, the script reports how many lines it processed. If it found any antivirus names, it lists them. If not, it informs the user that no antivirus software names were found.
