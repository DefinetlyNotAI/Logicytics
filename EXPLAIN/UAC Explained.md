# Powershell Script Explanation

This PowerShell script is designed to toggle the User Account Control (UAC) setting on a Windows system. It checks the current UAC status, enables or disables UAC based on its current state, and optionally restarts the computer to apply the changes. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

## Script Breakdown

### Define the path to the UAC settings in the registry

```powershell
$UACPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"
```

This line defines the registry path where the UAC settings are stored. The `EnableLUA` value under this path controls whether UAC is enabled (1) or disabled (0).

### Check the current UAC setting

```powershell
$UACStatus = Get-ItemProperty -Path $UACPath -Name "EnableLUA" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

This command retrieves the current UAC setting from the registry. The `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` parameter ensures that the script continues to run even if the `EnableLUA` value is not found.

### Determine UAC status and toggle

The script then checks if `$UACStatus` is `$null`, which would indicate that the UAC status could not be determined. If this is the case, it prints an error message. Otherwise, it checks the value of `EnableLUA`:

- If `EnableLUA` is 1 (UAC is enabled), it sets `EnableLUA` to 0 (disables UAC) and asks the user if they want to restart the computer.
- If `EnableLUA` is not 1 (UAC is disabled), it sets `EnableLUA` to 1 (enables UAC) and also asks the user if they want to restart the computer.

### Confirm restart

```powershell
$confirmation = Read-Host
```

This line prompts the user to confirm whether they want to restart the computer. The user's input is stored in the `$confirmation` variable.

### Restart the computer

```powershell
if ($confirmation -eq "Y" -or $confirmation -eq "y") {
    Write-Host "INFO: Restarting the computer..."
    Restart-Computer -Force
} else {
    Write-Host "INFO: Restart canceled by user."
}
```

If the user confirms the restart (by entering "Y" or "y"), the script forces a restart of the computer using `Restart-Computer -Force`. If the user does not confirm the restart, the script informs the user that the restart was canceled.

## Usage

This script is useful for system administrators or users who need to quickly enable or disable UAC on a Windows system. It provides a simple way to toggle UAC and optionally restart the computer to apply the changes. However, it's important to note that changing UAC settings can affect the security and functionality of the system, so it should be done with caution and understanding of the implications.
