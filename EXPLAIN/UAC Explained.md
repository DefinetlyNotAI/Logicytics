# PowerShell Script Explanation

This PowerShell script is designed to toggle the User Account Control (UAC) setting on a Windows system. UAC is a feature introduced in Windows Vista to prevent unauthorized changes to the system and improve the overall security posture. The script allows users to switch UAC on or off and optionally restart the computer to apply the changes.

## Code Breakdown

### Defining Registry Path

```powershell
$UACPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"
```

This line defines the registry key path where the UAC setting is stored. Modifying this value effectively enables or disables UAC.

### Checking Current UAC Setting

```powershell
$UACStatus = Get-ItemProperty -Path $UACPath -Name "EnableLUA" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

The script attempts to read the current state of UAC by querying the `EnableLUA` value under the specified registry path. The `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` parameter ensures that the script continues running even if the query fails due to insufficient permissions.

### Handling UAC Status

```powershell
if ($null -eq $UACStatus) {
    Write-Host "ERROR: UAC status could not be determined. Please ensure the script is run with administrative privileges."
} elseif ($UACStatus.EnableLUA -eq 1) {
    # UAC is on, disable it
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $UACPath -Name "EnableLUA" -Value 0
    Write-Host "INFO: UAC has been disabled. Would you like to restart the computer now? (Y/N)"
} else {
    # UAC is off, enable it
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $UACPath -Name "EnableLUA" -Value 1
    Write-Host "INFO: UAC has been enabled. Would you like to restart the computer now? (Y/N)"
}
```

Based on the current UAC status:
- If the status cannot be determined (likely due to lack of administrative privileges), an error message is displayed.
- If UAC is currently enabled (`EnableLUA` equals 1), the script disables it by setting `EnableLUA` to 0 and prompts the user to restart the computer.
- If UAC is currently disabled, the script enables it by setting `EnableLUA` to 1 and also prompts the user to restart the computer.

### Confirming Restart

```powershell
$confirmation = Read-Host
```

The script waits for user input to confirm whether they want to restart the computer to apply the changes.

```powershell
if ($confirmation -eq "Y" -or $confirmation -eq "y") {
    Write-Host "INFO: Restarting the computer..."
    Restart-Computer -Force
} else {
    Write-Host "INFO: Restart canceled by user."
}
```

If the user confirms with "Y" or "y", the script forces a restart of the computer using `Restart-Computer -Force`. If the user does not confirm, a message is displayed indicating that the restart was canceled.

## Conclusion

This script provides a straightforward way to toggle UAC on or off and offers the option to restart the computer immediately after changing the setting. It's a useful tool for administrators who need to adjust UAC settings frequently or for users who prefer to manage their security settings manually.
