# Python Script Explanation

This Python script uses the `pyautogui` library to automate the process of enabling the Command Prompt on a Windows system through the Registry Editor. It follows these steps:

1. **Wait**: The script starts by waiting for 2 seconds to ensure it's ready to run. This delay can be adjusted based on the system's responsiveness.

2. **Open Run Dialog**: It simulates pressing the `Win+R` keys to open the Run dialog box, which is used to execute commands directly from the Windows desktop.

3. **Wait for Run Dialog**: After opening the Run dialog, the script waits for 1 second to ensure the dialog is ready to accept input.

4. **Type Command**: It then uses `pyautogui.write` to type a command into the Run dialog. This command uses `REG add` to modify the Windows Registry and set the `DisableCMD` value under `HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System` to `0`, effectively enabling the Command Prompt. The `/k` switch is used to keep the Command Prompt window open after executing the command.

5. **Execute Command**: After typing the command, the script simulates pressing the `Enter` key to execute the command.

6. **Wait for Command Execution**: It waits for 5 seconds to allow the command to execute and the Command Prompt window to open. This delay can vary based on system performance and the time it takes for the Registry change to take effect.

7. **Close Command Prompt**: Once the Command Prompt window is open, the script simulates pressing `Alt+F4` to close the window.

8. **Wait for Window Closure**: Finally, it waits for 2 seconds to ensure the Command Prompt window is closed before proceeding.

9. **Print Completion Message**: The script prints a message indicating that the command has been executed to enable the Command Prompt, and the window has been closed.

## Usage

This script is useful for automating the process of enabling the Command Prompt on a Windows system, which can be particularly helpful in environments where the Command Prompt is disabled by default. It provides a quick and efficient way to re-enable the Command Prompt without manually navigating through the Registry Editor or Group Policy settings.

However, it's important to note that modifying the Windows Registry can have significant effects on the system's behavior and security. Therefore, this script should be used with caution and understanding of the implications. Additionally, the use of `pyautogui` for automating keyboard and mouse inputs can be affected by screen resolution, DPI settings, and other factors, so it may require adjustments for different systems or environments.
