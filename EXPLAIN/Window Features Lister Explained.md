# Batch Script Explanation

This batch script is designed to list all enabled Windows features and save the output to a text file named after the current user. It performs several key operations:

1. **Echo Information**: It starts by echoing a message to the console to indicate that it is listing all enabled Windows features.

2. **Get Current User's Name**: It retrieves the current user's name and stores it in the `USERNAME` variable. This is done by simply echoing the `%USERNAME%` environment variable, which is automatically set by the system to the name of the current user.

3. **Check for and Create `DATA` Folder**: It checks if a folder named `DATA` exists in the current directory. If not, it creates this folder using the `mkdir` command. This is done to ensure that the script has a directory to save the output file.

4. **List Enabled Windows Features and Save to File**: It uses the `dism` command to list all enabled Windows features. The `/online` option specifies that the operation should be performed on the running operating system, and the `/get-features` option lists all features. The output is formatted as a table and redirected to a text file named after the current user inside the `DATA` folder. The `>` operator is used to redirect the output of the command to a file.

5. **Echo Output File Path**: It echoes a message to the console indicating that the list of enabled Windows features has been saved to a text file named after the current user inside the `DATA` folder.

6. **Log Command Output**: It echoes a message to the console indicating that the command output has been logged to the specified text file.

## Usage

This script is useful for system administrators or users who need to quickly list all enabled Windows features and save the output for later review. It provides a straightforward way to generate a list of enabled features, which can be helpful for understanding the current state of Windows features or for auditing purposes.
