# Python Script Explanation

This Python script is designed to toggle the User Account Control (UAC) setting on a Windows system using PowerShell commands. It queries the current UAC setting, changes it to the opposite value, and optionally restarts the computer to apply the changes. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

## Script Breakdown

### Import Required Module

```python
import subprocess
```

The script imports the `subprocess` module, which allows it to run PowerShell commands from within the Python script.

### `get_uac_setting()`

This function uses `subprocess.run` to execute a PowerShell command that queries the current UAC setting from the Windows Registry. It captures the output, extracts the value, and returns it.

### `set_uac_setting(value)`

This function uses `subprocess.run` to execute a PowerShell command that sets the UAC setting in the Windows Registry to the specified value. It does not capture the output or return a value.

### `main()`

The `main` function orchestrates the execution of the script:

1. It prints a message indicating that the script has started executing.
2. It calls `get_uac_setting` to retrieve the current UAC setting and prints it.
3. It determines the new UAC setting by toggling the current setting (changing '1' to '0' or vice versa) and calls `set_uac_setting` with the new value.
4. It prints a message asking the user to restart their computer for the changes to take effect.
5. It prompts the user to confirm whether they want to restart their computer. If the user confirms, it uses `subprocess.run` to execute a PowerShell command that restarts the computer immediately. If the user does not confirm, it prints a message indicating that the restart was canceled.

## Execution

The script is executed by calling the `main` function. This initiates the process of toggling the UAC setting and optionally restarting the computer.

## Usage

This script is useful for system administrators or users who need to quickly enable or disable UAC on a Windows system. It provides a simple way to toggle UAC and optionally restart the computer to apply the changes. However, it's important to note that changing UAC settings can affect the security and functionality of the system, so it should be done with caution and understanding of the implications.
