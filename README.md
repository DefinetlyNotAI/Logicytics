## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Installation and Setup

To install and setup Logicytics, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Logicytics requires Python modules. You can install all the required modules by running the following command in your terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Run Logicytics**: To run Logicytics, simply run the following command in your terminal: `python Logicytics.py -h` - This opens a help menu.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: The project requires Python 3.8 or higher. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Dependencies**: The project requires certain Python modules to be installed. You can install all the required modules by running the following command in your terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

![Admin Error](IMG/NeedAdmin.png "Not using admin will result in a soft crash")

- **Administrative Privileges**: To be able to run the program using certain features of the project, like registry modification, you must run the program with administrative privileges.

- **System Requirements**: The project has been tested on Windows 10 and 11. It will not work on other operating systems.

- **Knowledge of Command Line**: The project uses command line options for the user to interact with the program. It is recommended to have a basic understanding of command line options.

- **Optional**: Create a `.ignore` file in the `CODE/SysInternal_Suite` directory to not extract the exe binaries from the ZIP file (This is done for the OpenSSF score), if the `.ignore` file is not found, it will auto extract the details

## Step-by-Step Installation</h2>

1) Install Python üêç
If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">official website</a>.
Make sure to select the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2) Install Dependencies üì¶
Logicytics requires Python modules. You can install all the required modules by running the following command in your terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3) Run Logicytics üöÄ
To run Logicytics, simply run the following command in your terminal:
<code>python Logicytics.py -h</code>
This opens a help menu.

4) Run the Program üëæ
Once you have run the program, you can run the program with the following command:
`python Logicytics.py -h`
Replace the flags with the ones you want to use.
You Must use Admin!

5) Wait for magic to happen üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Logicytics will now run and gather data according to the flags you used.

6) Enjoy the gathered data üéâ
Once the program has finished running, you can find the gathered data in the "Data" folder.

7) Share the love ‚ù§Ô∏è
If you like Logicytics, please consider sharing it with others or spreading the word about it.

8) Contribute to the project üë•
If you have an idea or want to contribute to the project, you can submit an issue or PR on the <a href="https://github.com/DefinetlyNotAI/Logicytics">GitHub repository</a>.


### Basic Usage

![The flag options](IMG/Flag%20Options.png "Here are the options Logicytics has")

After running and successfully collecting data, you may traverse the ACCESS directory as much as you like,
Remove add and delete files, it's the safest directory where your backups, hashes, data zips and logs are found.

Also watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVTBmdTQqOs) for a better understanding of Logicytics

## üîß Configuration üîß

Logicytics uses a config.json file to store configurations. The config.json is located in the CODE directory.

The config.json file is a JSON file that contains the following information:

```json
{
    "WEBHOOK URL": "",
    "ipgeolocation.io API KEY": "",
    "DEBUG": true,
    "VERSION": "2.0.0",
    "CURRENT_FILES": [
        "browser_miner.ps1",
        "driverquery.py",
        "log_miner.py",
        "media_backup.py",
        "netadapter.ps1"
    ]
}
```

The config.json file is used to store the webhook URL, 
the API key for ipgeolocation.io, the DEBUG flag, the VERSION, and the CURRENT_FILES.

CURRENT_FILES is an array of strings that contains the names of the files you have, 
this is used to later check for corruption or bugs.

Do not modify CURRENT_FILES and VERSION unless you are developing extra add-ons

## üöÄ Advanced Usage üöÄ

![Main 3 Directories](IMG/3dir.png "The 3 Main Directories")

### Mods

Mods are special files that are run with the `--modded` flag.
These files are essentially scripts that are run after the main Logicytics.py script is run
and the verified scripts are run.

They are used to add extra functionality to the script. 
They are located in the `MODS` directory. In order to make a mod, 
you need to create a python file with the `.py` extension or any of the supported extensions `.exe .ps1 .bat`
in the `MODS` directory. 

These file will be run after the main script is run. 
When making a mod, you should avoid acting based on other files directly, 
as this can cause conflicts with the data harvesting. 
Instead, you should use the `Logicytics.py` file and other scripts as a reference 
for how to add features to the script.

The `--modded` flag is used to run all files in the `MODS` directory. 
This flag is not needed for other files in the `CODE` directory to run,
but it is needed for mods to run. 

The `--modded` flag can also be used to run custom scripts.
If you want to run a custom script with the `--modded` flag, 
you can add the script to the `MODS` directory, and it will be run with the `--modded` flag.

To check all the mods and how to make your own, you can check the `Logicytics.py` file and the WIKI.

## üõë Troubleshooting üõë

If you are having issues, here are some troubleshooting tips:

Some errors may not necessarily mean the script is at fault, 
but other OS related faults like files not existing,
or files not being modified, or files not being created.

Some tips are:
- Check if the script is running as admin
- Check if the script is not running in a VM
- Check if the script has the correct permissions to run
- Check if the script has the correct dependencies installed
- Check if the script is not being blocked by a firewall or antivirus
- Check if the script is not being blocked by a VPN
- Check if the script is not being blocked by a proxy
- Check if any of the scripts are not being modified or created
- Check if the script is not being removed
- Check if the script is not being blocked by any other software or service

If those don't work attempt:
- Try running the script with powershell instead of cmd, or vice versa
- Try running the script in a different directory
- Try running the script in a different computer
- Try running the script with a different python version above 3.8
