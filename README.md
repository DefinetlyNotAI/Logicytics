### Basic Usage

After running and successfully collecting data, you may traverse the ACCESS directory as much as you like,
Remove add and delete files, it's the safe directory where your backups, hashes, data zips and logs are found.

> [!TIP]
> Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVTBmdTQqOs) to see a real life demo of Logicytics (Although the tools and interface may be changed as it's an older version `2.1.1` - `2.3.3`)

## üîß Configuration üîß

Logicytics uses a config.ini file to store configurations. The config.ini is located in the CODE directory.

The config.ini file is a INI file that contains the following information:

```ini
[Settings]
# Would you like to enable debug mode?
# This will print out more information to the console, with prefix DEBUG
# This will not be logged however
log_using_debug = false
# Would you like for new logs to be created every execution?
# Or would you like to append to the same log file?
delete_old_logs = false

[System Settings]
# Do not play with these settings unless you know what you are doing
version = 3.0.0
files = "browser_miner.ps1, cmd_commands.py, dir_list.py, event_log.py, Logicytics.py, log_miner.py, media_backup.py, netadapter.ps1, packet_sniffer.py, property_scraper.ps1, registry.py, sensitive_data_miner.py, ssh_miner.py, sys_internal.py, tasklist.py, tree.ps1, vulnscan.py, wifi_stealer.py, window_feature_miner.ps1, wmic.py, _debug.py, _dev.py, _extra.py, logicytics\Checks.py, logicytics\Execute.py, logicytics\FileManagement.py, logicytics\Flag.py, logicytics\Get.py, logicytics\Logger.py, logicytics\__init__.py, VulnScan\tools\_test_gpu_acceleration.py, VulnScan\tools\_vectorizer.py, VulnScan\v2-deprecated\_generate_data.py, VulnScan\v2-deprecated\_train.py, VulnScan\v3\_generate_data.py, VulnScan\v3\_train.py"

###################################################
# The following settings are for specific modules #
###################################################

[PacketSniffer Settings]
# The interface to sniff packets on, keep it as WiFi for most cases
# Autocorrects between WiFi and Wi-Fi
interface = WiFi
# The number of packets to sniff,
packet_count = 10000
# The time to timeout the sniffing process
timeout = 10

###################################################

[VulnScan.train Settings]
# The following settings are for the Train module for training models
# NeuralNetwork seems to be the best choice for this task
# Options: "NeuralNetwork", "LogReg",
#          "RandomForest", "ExtraTrees", "GBM",
#          "XGBoost", "DecisionTree", "NaiveBayes"
model_name = NeuralNetwork
# General Training Parameters
epochs = 10
batch_size = 32
learning_rate = 0.001
use_cuda = true

# Paths to train and save data
train_data_path = C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Model Tests\Model Data\GeneratedData
# If all models are to be trained, this is the path to save all models,
# and will be appended with the model codename and follow naming convention
save_model_path = C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Model Tests\Model SenseMini

[VulnScan.generate Settings]
# The following settings are for the Generate module for fake training data
extensions = .txt, .log, .md, .csv, .json, .xml, .html, .yaml, .ini, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx
save_path = C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Model Tests\Generated Data
# Options include:
# 'Sense' - Generates 50k files, each 25KB in size.
# 'SenseNano' - Generates 5 files, each 5KB in size.
# 'SenseMacro' - Generates 1m files, each 10KB in size.
# 'SenseMini' - Generates 10k files, each 10KB in size.
# 'SenseCustom' - Uses custom size settings from the configuration file.
code_name = SenseMini
# This allows more randomness in the file sizes, use 0 to disable
# this is applied randomly every time a file is generated
# Variation is applied in the following way:
# size +- (size */ variation) where its random weather to add or subtract and divide or multiply
size_variation = 0.1
# Set to SenseCustom to use below size settings
min_file_size = 5KB
max_file_size = 50KB
# Chances for the following data types in files:
# 0.0 - 1.0, the rest will be for pure data
full_sensitive_chance = 0.07
partial_sensitive_chance = 0.2

[VulnScan.vectorizer Settings]
# The following settings are for the Vectorizer module for vectorizing data
# Usually it automatically vectorizes data, but this is for manual vectorization

# We advise to use this vectorization, although not knowing the vectorizer is not advised
# as this may lead to ValueErrors due to different inputs
# Use the vectorizer supplied for any v3 model on SenseMini

# The path to the data to vectorize, either a file or a directory
data_path = C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Model Tests\Model Data\GeneratedData
# The path to save the vectorized data - It will automatically be appended '\Vectorizer.pkl'
# Make sure the path is a directory, and it exists
output_path = C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Model Tests\Model Sense - Vectorizer

# Vectorizer to use, options include:
# tfidf or count - The code for the training only supports tfidf - we advise to use tfidf
vectorizer_type = tfidf
```

The config.ini file is used to store the DEBUG flag bool, the VERSION, and the CURRENT_FILES.
It is also used to store and save settings for other programs.

> [!TIP]
> CURRENT_FILES is an array of strings that contains the names of the files you have, 
> this is used to later check for corruption or bugs.
> VERSION is the version of the project, used to check and pull for updates.

## üöÄ Advanced Usage üöÄ

### Mods

Mods are special files that are run with the `--modded` flag.
These files are essentially scripts that are run after the main Logicytics.py script is run
and the verified scripts are run.

They are used to add extra functionality to the script. 
They are located in the `MODS` directory. In order to make a mod, 
you need to create a python file with the `.py` extension or any of the supported extensions `.exe .ps1 .bat`
in the `MODS` directory. 

These file will be run after the main script is run. 
When making a mod, you should avoid acting based on other files directly, 
as this can cause conflicts with the data harvesting. 
Instead, you should use the `Logicytics.py` file and other scripts as a reference 
for how to add features to the script.

The `--modded` flag is used to run all files in the `MODS` directory. 
This flag is not needed for other files in the `CODE` directory to run,
but it is needed for mods to run. 

The `--modded` flag can also be used to run custom scripts.
If you want to run a custom script with the `--modded` flag, 
you can add the script to the `MODS` directory, and it will be run with the `--modded` flag.

To check all the mods and how to make your own, you can check the `Logicytics.py` file and the Wiki.
Also refer to the contributing.md for more info

## üõë Troubleshooting üõë

If you are having issues, here are some troubleshooting tips:

Some errors may not necessarily mean the script is at fault, 
but other OS related faults like files not existing,
or files not being modified, or files not being created.

Some tips are:
- Check if the script is running as admin and not in a VM
- Check if the script has the correct permissions and correct dependencies to run
- Check if the script is not being blocked by a firewall or antivirus or by a VPN or proxy
- Check if the script is not being blocked by any other software or service

If those don't work attempt:
- Try running the script with powershell instead of cmd, or vice versa
- Try running the script in a different directory, computer or python version above 3.8
  - Note: The version used to develop, test and run the script is 3.11
- Try running the `--debug` flag and check the logs
