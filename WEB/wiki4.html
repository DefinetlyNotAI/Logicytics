            <h1>Debugging & Diagnostics</h1>
            <p>Logicytics provides powerful debugging and diagnostic tools to help developers identify and resolve issues efficiently. Understanding and utilizing these features will greatly enhance your development workflow and ensure your application runs smoothly.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Methods</h2>

                <h3>1. Live Feedback</h3>
                <p>During the execution of a program, live feedback provides immediate insights into the application's behaviour. This feature is crucial for identifying issues early in the development process. It might include outputting logs to the console or real-time analysis of performance metrics. Live feedback helps developers quickly understand the flow of their program and spot any irregularities as they occur.</p>

                <h3>2. Debug Mode</h3>
                <p>Debug mode enhances the live feedback mechanism by providing more detailed information during runtime. This involves inspecting variable values at specific points and offering extra insights into the main program to aid developers in understanding how their code is executing. To activate debug mode, set <code>debug</code> to <code>true</code> in the <code>config.json</code> file. This mode is particularly useful when troubleshooting complex issues or when additional context is needed during the program's operation.</p>

                <h3>3. Debugger</h3>
                <p>The debugger component is a powerful tool for analyzing the state of a program at various points in time. It checks for file integrity, updates, and file structure, ensuring that the codebase is consistent and up-to-date. Additionally, the debugger can analyze the operating system and other external factors that might affect the application's behaviour. Debuggers are essential for diagnosing subtle bugs that are difficult to reproduce consistently. You can run the debugger by using the <code>--debug</code> flag.</p>
