                <h2>Overview of Logicytics</h2>
                <p>
                    Logicytics is a specialized software tool designed for the purpose of collecting and harvesting a broad spectrum of data from Windows systems. 
                    This data is crucial for forensic investigations, allowing investigators to analyze system activities, identify potential security breaches, 
                    and reconstruct events leading up to incidents. The tool is particularly valuable in digital forensics, where the ability to extract detailed 
                    information from a system under investigation is paramount.
